<h3>A modern and performant Minecraft server written in Kotlin</h3>
</div>

<br>

# Overview
sculk.kt is a fast, reliable, open source, and innovative Minecraft server software
written in Kotlin, designed to be compatible with the Java Edition of Minecraft without using
any Mojang code.

> [!NOTE]
> Sculk is currently not ready for use in production, nor is it playable by any means. This
> is an early alpha preview and things may not work as expected or at all. We will offer no support
> for bugs caused by incomplete features.

## Why use Sculk
Unlike [Minestom](https://minestom.net), [Feather](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather?tab=readme-ov-file)
or [Valence](https://valence.rs), Sculk requires zero programming knowledge to get started and just simply works. At
the moment, Sculk currently lacks a substantial portion of features, so if you are looking for something fully feature complete,
we suggest taking a look at one of the platforms mentioned above or [Paper](https://papermc.io/).

## Goals
Sculk aims to be the following:
- Fully feature complete
- Up to date with the most modern versions of Minecraft
- Memory efficient and performant
- Incredibly extensible
